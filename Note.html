"XHR Failed" error when attempting to install VS Code Extension
Brand new Windows 10 Dell out of the box.
Installed VS Code then tried to install extension, specifically the 'Salesforce Extension Pack', but I see reports of this error for other extensions too.
It failed to install with 'XHR Failed'.
Just on home wifi here, no corporate firewall, proxy, VPN or anything.

Got it working with the help of this post
Press Windows key and type 'Network Connections'
Select 'View Network Connections'
Right click the network that you are connected to and select 'Properties'
Click 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and 'Properties'
Click 'Use the following DNS server addresses' and enter
Preferred DNS Server: 8.8.8.8
Alternate DNS Server: 8.8.4.4
(These are Google's DNS servers)
Click 'OK', 'Close'
Press Windows key and enter 'cmd'
Click on 'Command Prompt'
Type
ipconfig /flushdns
enter
Restart VS Code and try again to install extension
